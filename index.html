			<p class="intro">A report released by Food Trade News said that Key Food Stores Co-Operative, a New Jersey-based cooperative of around 400 grocery stores, has overtaken longtime market leader Krasdale Foods as the supermarket operator with the highest sales in New York City.
			</p>
				<p>
					Key Food has grown from 200 city stores in 2019 to 231 in 2023, with sales increasing from around $2.1 billion in 2019 to $2.6 billion in 2023. Krasdale’s sales, meanwhile, have declined from $2.7 billion in 2019 to $2.2 billion in 2023. Their store base declined sharply from 348 New York City stores in 2019 to 286 in 2023.
				</p>
				<p>
					Both Key Food and Krasdale are groups of independent store owners, and owners may join or leave at any time. Part of Key Food’s growth has been from independent store owners joining.
				</p>
				<p>
					Some store managers say aligning with Key Food helps them. Nadia Diaz, a manager at a store in Melrose, the Bronx that recently joined Key Food, said that the new affiliation helps her store lower prices and offer a better selection of products.
				</p>
				<p>
					Others, though, see a change as strictly operational. Carmen Medina manages two supermarkets in the Bronx that joined and then left Krasdale in 2019, but said that there were no real changes.
				</p>
				<p>
					“It was an administrative change,” she said.
				</p>
				<p>
					Annette Nielsen, the executive director of the New York City Food Policy Center, said that changing affiliation can change prices in the stores.
				</p>
				<p>
					“It’s linked to different supply chains,” she said.
