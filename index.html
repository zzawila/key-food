			<p class="intro">Key Food Stores Co-Operative has overtaken longtime market leader Krasdale Foods as the supermarket operator with the highest sales in New York City, according to a Food Trade News report.
				</p>
				<p>
				New Jersey-based Key Food has grown from 200 city stores in 2019 to 231 in 2023, while Westchester County-based Krasdale’s store base declined sharply from 348 in 2019 to 286 in 2023.
				</p>
				<p>
				Both Key Food and Krasdale are groups of independent store owners, and owners may join or leave at any time. Part of Key Food’s growth has been from independent store owners joining. Krasdale affiliates run C-Town and Bravo supermarkets, along with independent stores, while Key Food owners also run stores under Food Dynasty, Food Universe, Food Fair, The Food Emporium, SuperFresh, and other names.
				</p>
				<p>
				Some store managers say aligning with Key Food helps them. Nadia Diaz, a manager at a store in Melrose, the Bronx that recently joined Key Food, said that the new affiliation helps her store lower prices, offer a better selection of products, and improve a customer loyalty card program.
				</p>
				<p>
				In a <a href="https://motthavenherald.com/2023/11/20/how-much-will-your-thanksgiving-dinner-cost/" target="_blank">recent analysis for the Mott Haven Herald</a>, two Key Food-affiliated supermarkets had the lowest prices for a sample basket. Meanwhile, a C-Town had the highest prices.
				</p>
				<p>
				Annette Nielsen, the executive director of the New York City Food Policy Center, said that changing affiliation can change prices in the stores.
				</p>
				<p>
				“It’s linked to different supply chains,” she said.
				</p>
				<p>
				Krasdale Foods runs their own warehouse in the South Bronx. Key Food is supplied by UNFI, a large grocery wholesaler.
